# -Dynamic-Memory-Management-and-Data-Type-
a program that will define the data type and operations of an Ordered Set.  A set is a 
collection of distinct or unique values. Since this set is ordered, its elements are arranged in 
ascending order.  A set is an example of a dynamic data structure where the collection of 
data in memory has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size.  The basic operations of 
sets include the following: 
 
1. Set create() : returns an empty set  
2. Set add (Set s, e): adds e to the Set s, and returns the pointer to the 
first element of Set s  
3. Set union (Set s1, Set s2):   returns a new ordered Set created by 
merging the elements of sets S1 and S2.  
4. Set intersection (Set s1, Set s2):   returns a new ordered Set 
containing the common elements of sets S1 and S2.  
5. Set difference (Set s1, Set s2):   returns a new ordered Set 
containing the unique elements in S1, that are not found in S2.  
6. void print (Set s): displays on screen the elements of the ordered Set 
s. 
 
The ordered set will be implemented in C as a linked list.
